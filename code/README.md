# Code

This folder contains code used for analysis. These files call on the [wrangling files](../data-raw/wrangle) to clean data, then produce static visualizations. Some of these visualizations are included in the [shiny dashboard](../documents/img).

### Editor's Note

As of yet, I have been unable to recreate some of the analysis here, even when including the NC data. As such, I cannot link these visualizations to the ones called by the group's [shiny app](../documents/app_dashboard.Rmd).
