## Project Description

In this project, we will use the publicly available North Carolina voter
history and registration files to create demographic profiles of voters in the
2012, 2014, and 2016 elections. Then these profiles will be compared with
other measures of the population, including the Current Population Survey,
administered by Census Bureau and the Department of Labor. Finally, our
findings will be presented publicly on the Internet, allowing for anyone who is
interested to explore the difference between the actual population of North
Carolina and the voting population.
