## Outcome

Our project resulted in a [`shiny` dashboard](https://nc-elections.shinyapps.io/nc-elections) compiling our findings that allows users to explore the data interactively.

## Project Description

In this project, we will use the publicly available [North Carolina voter
history and registration files](http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/) to
create demographic profiles of voters in the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections.
Then these profiles will be compared with other measures of the voting
population, including the Current Population Survey, administered by Census
Bureau and the Department of Labor. Finally, our findings will be presented
publicly on the Internet, allowing for anyone who is interested to explore the
difference between the actual population of North Carolina and the voting
population.

#### Editor's Note

This project was way more complex than most, and I wasn't able to access some of the data used. Details about these issues are contained in individual folder READMEs. The shiny dashboard linked to above is static, however, and will run fine.

This repo is organized following the guidelines outlined [here](https://github.com/ds-elections/summer-2017/blob/master/RepoProposal/documents/RepoProposal.md), adapted for use in this class from work by [Project TIER](http://www.projecttier.org/) and [Thomas Leeper](http://thomasleeper.com/2016/11/analysis-as-package/)
