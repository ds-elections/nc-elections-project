## Project Description

In this project, we will use the publicly available [North Carolina voter 
history and registration files](http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/) to
create demographic profiles of voters in the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections.
Then these profiles will be compared with other measures of the voting
population, including the Current Population Survey, administered by Census
Bureau and the Department of Labor. Finally, our findings will be presented
publicly on the Internet, allowing for anyone who is interested to explore the
difference between the actual population of North Carolina and the voting
population.
